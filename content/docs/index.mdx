description: Animated components and design blocks crafted for smooth interaction and rich detail
---

A growing set of animated components designed to drop smoothly into any React project.
Crafted for clean structure, clear behavior, and simple reuse.
Just copy, paste, and make them yours.

More animations, interactive sections, and design tools are on the way.

## Motivation

twc-ui is all about thoughtful design and smooth interaction. Each component is made to look clean and feel right, bringing a natural flow to your interface.

It follows the same simple and flexible approach as Shadcn, but with animation built in from the beginning.

    directly
    into your project.
